\section{Project Works}
\subsection{Academic Projects}
\cvline{Mini Project Home Security System }{It is having various sensors incorporated in it for the detection of intruders and some sensors to sense some natural mishaps like fire etc. It is having a temperature sensor(LM 35), a smoke sensor and a motion detector(PIR Sensor). A receiver is there to show the signal if anyone of the sensor is active it can be taken to a distant place according to the power of the transmitter and receiver(TWS \& RWS 434).}
\cvline{Main Project Image Fusion/Mosaicing}{Many problems require finding the coordinate transformation between two images of the same scene or object. One of them is Image Mosaicing/ Image warping. It is important to have a precise description of the coordinate transformation between a pair of images. Image mosaics are collection of overlapping images together with coordinate transformations that relate the different image coordinate systems. By applying the appropriate transformations via a warping operation and merging the overlapping regions of a warped image, it is possible to construct a single image covering the entire visible area of the scene. This merged single image is the motivation for the term ``mosaic''. The project is  implemented in MATLAB.}
\subsection{Freelance Electronics/Robotics Projects}
\cvline{}{\textbf{Light Controlled Switch} -  can be used to switch ON an incandescent bulb (or any appliance) automatically during the evening time i.e., when the sun light fades. The circuit consisted of a 555 Timer (used as Comparator) and LDR (Light Sensor).}
\cvline{}{\textbf{Water Tank Level Indicating and Controlling System using LDR} - had two special features that other level controlling systems in the market lacked – low cost implementation and elimination of all kind of immersions into the water. The op-amp IC LM324 and a LDR were used to realize the circuit.}
\cvline{}{\textbf{Arduino Voltmeter} - Arduino board uses ATmega series of Microcontrollers of Atmel AVR Family. The range of the voltmeter will be between 0 and 10 volts DC – ideal for testing batteries and cells before they head to the garbage bin.}
\cvline{}{\textbf{Light Chasing Robot} – A simple robot that follows the light (in a dark room). It used LDR as the light sensor.}
\cvline{}{\textbf{Line Following Robot} – A highly useful robot that could follow the line drawn on a surface. An IR LED was the sensor used.}
\cvline{}{\textbf{PC Controlled Robot} – A robot that could be navigated through a particular path using a computer. It worked by processing the data received from a computer’s serial port with microcontroller (Arduino).}
\cvline{}{\textbf{Obstacle Avoiding Robot} – This robot could take a deviation in its path whenever it detected any obstacle that blocked its path. IR LED was used to detect the obstacle.}
\cvline{}{\textbf{Sound Operated Robot} – A robot that responds to the sound (eg: a clap). It is programmed to deviate its path when it detects a sound signal. The sensor used wasa normal microphone.}
\cvline{}{\textbf{Email Controlled Home Appliances}-Home Appliances can be controlled using email.The project uses Arduino board and a python script which helps to fetch mail and reply.} 
\subsection{Software Projects}
\cvline{}{Customisation of  Python based software for conducting IT examination for IT@SCHOOL.} 
\cvline{}{Various scripts (Python\& shell) for System Administration.}
